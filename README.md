## Description

This webpage is designed to run a simple game of blackjack between the user and the dealer. Upon winning games the user can add it to their high score. This was built out of a desire to create a webpage using APIs that used the API to operate logic rather than merely output it's content. The game solves boredom by allowing you to play blackjack whenever you desire.

## Installation

The blackjack game should be live and playable at the url.

## Usage

Launch the webpage and navigate to the play button. This will launch the game of blackjack. From there you can use the 'Hit' and 'Stay' buttons to attempt to beat the dealer. Your wins can be logged into the highscores page.
